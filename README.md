# BSP
Bedrock Server Pilot is a program designed to make managing a Minecraft Bedrock dedicated server a breeze

# To do
  - a console window that supports color
  - add an autoupdate module that would automatically update the Bedrock dedicated server (with a disable toggle too :D)
  - make an autorestart module that supports custom time selection
  - make an automatic addon manager
  - make an automatic backup module
  - make an automatic command input module (the user selects a command and a timer, on how often they want to run the command)
  - make a performance analysis module (graph drawing system for checking CPU/RAM usage corresponding to playercounts and other factors)
  - make a multicore cpu usage meter module
  - make a decent playercount module that can work with addons/plugins that change the joining message
  - make a player management module
  - make a log saving module
  - make a log analysis module
# other STUFF
  - add basic BDSX support
  - add a quick access section to the program if BDSX is detected in the root of where the program is running
  
# maybe will do
  - an antilag like system that would input the kill command for grounded items with a selectable timer
  - add LiteLoaderBDS support?
