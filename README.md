# Bedrock Server Pilot

# To do
  - Central console (in progress)
  - Add an autoupdate module that would automatically update the Bedrock dedicated server (with a disable toggle too :D)
  - Add ingame chat in the gui (complete)
  - Make an autorestart module that supports custom time selection, with automatic backups at each restart
  - Make an automatic addon pilot (complete)
  - Make an automatic backup pilot (in progress)
  - Make an automatic command input module (the user selects a command and a timer, on how often they want to run the command)
  - Make a performance analysis module (graph drawing system for checking CPU/RAM usage corresponding to playercounts and other factors)
  - Make a multicore cpu usage meter module (in progress)
  - Make a decent playercount module that can work with addons/plugins that change the joining message
  - Make a player management module
  - Make a log saving module
  - Make a log analysis module
# Other STUFF
  - Add basic BDSX support
  - Add a quick access section to the program if BDSX is detected in the root of where the program is running
  
# Maybe will do
  - An antilag like system that would input the kill command for grounded items with a selectable timer
  - Ddd LiteLoaderBDS support?
